Sources of Data for Analysis:

• IRS Individual Income Tax Statistics by Zip Code, 2017 https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-2017-zip-code-data-soi

• Indiana DOE School Corporation Data, 2017 https://www.doe.in.gov/accountability/find-school-and-corporation-data-reports

### Data Exploration: 

Is there a correlation between higher median income and higher test scores in Indiana?
Is there a correlation between Muncie, Fort Wayne, and Indianapolis’ median incomes and test scores? (narrowing our scope)

### Hypothesis

Hypothesis: “If there is a correlation between median income and test scores, then the r-value of income to test score ratio will be greater than .5”

Null Hypothesis: “If there is no correlation between median income and test scores in Indiana, then the r-value of income to test score ratio will be 0.”
